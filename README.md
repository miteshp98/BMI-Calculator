# Frontend Mentor BMI Calculator

## The [BMI Calculator]

This is a solution to the [Body Mass Index calculator challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/body-mass-index-calculator-brrBkfSz1T). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The project:

The challenge is designed to test more advanced layout skills, HTML form skills, and Vanilla JS skills. The shifting layouts are designed to be more challenging as they differ quite a bit at different screen sizes and there is little guidance on BMI calculations, so it required a lot of research to figure out how to calculate both metric and imperial BMIs, and then feed that back in a meaningful way to the user while keeping the JS as DRY as possible.

## My process:

HTML:
I structured the page using semantic HTML tags to ensure accessibility and improve the document's readability. This approach made the content more meaningful and easier to navigate, particularly for assistive technologies.

CSS:
For styling, I utilized CSS Grid and Flexbox, ensuring the layout was both flexible and responsive across different screen sizes. Media queries were implemented to further enhance responsiveness, allowing the BMI calculator to adapt seamlessly to various devices. The design is clean and user-friendly, with an intuitive interface for inputting data.

JavaScript:
The JavaScript code was written using an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. I encapsulated the calculator’s logic within a class, making the code modular and easier to maintain or extend in the future. Key functionalities such as input validation, BMI calculation (both metric and imperial), and UI updates are all handled within well-organized methods. This structure not only keeps the codebase clean but also promotes reusability.

This project highlights my ability to integrate modern web development practices into a cohesive and functional application. I’m excited to continue building and refining my skills as I take on more complex projects!

## Key learning:

Throughout this project, I honed my skills in several key areas of web development. I deepened my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript, learning how to structure code efficiently by encapsulating related functionalities within classes. This not only improved the organization and maintainability of the code but also made it easier to extend and adapt in the future.

In HTML, I focused on using semantic tags to enhance the accessibility and structure of the content, ensuring that the webpage is both user-friendly and SEO-friendly.

On the CSS side, I applied responsive design techniques using media queries, Flexbox, and Grid layout. This approach allowed me to create a layout that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent and engaging user experience.

Overall, this project was a comprehensive exercise in building a well-structured, responsive, and maintainable web application.
